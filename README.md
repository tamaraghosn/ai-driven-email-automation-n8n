Building a workflow that helps me manage job related emails efficiently.  
The goal? To never miss an important **application**, **assignment**, or **newsletter** and to turn a cluttered inbox into a structured, actionable system that keeps me on top of my career opportunities.

Sends concise summaries via **Telegram** and stores insights in **Notion** for easy access.
